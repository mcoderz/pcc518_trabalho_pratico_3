test,money-fx,0009941,bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation frankfurt april bundesbank board member claus koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies in a lecture at the university of surrey prereleased here koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them he said he added that west german growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to marks from above two marks at the start of koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods services and investments it was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow to reverse such a rise in the money stock interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off in other words the monetary policy measures required are different from and sometimes diametrically opposed to those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity koehler said the dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive us current account deficit but attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems the sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of us imports and a sharp fall in the cost of european imports but the volume effect of falling imports to the us and rising imports to europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term koehler said a reduction in the us current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of gnp was higher than domestic demand in japan and west germany by contrast domestic demand should rise faster than gnp in germany this did indeed happen in koehler said if a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented the us current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the us but only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would europe and japan look for financial investment in the us when selecting monetary policy instruments a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions koehler said the bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates it was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem the debt problem and the current account problem a strategy had to be designed that helped the safeguarding of noninflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions koehler said given the system of floating exchange rates it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene it sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set because they were only testing points for the market he said in order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies koehler said

appears to be satisfied tokyos latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies monetary sources said they believed that us treasury secretary james baker considered tokyos package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the japanese economy but yesterdays statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yens rise from around to the dollar the level at the february paris accord to about today and the initial reaction of currency markets in the far east demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so the yen sank below at one point despite intervention by the bank of japan kiichi miyazawa japans finance minister said the movement since paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the february talks i would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in paris miyazawa said yesterday the supplementary budget worth about billion dlrs was announced by the ruling liberal democratic party on the eve of miyazawas departure for washington to attend yesterdays meetings of leading industrial nations in a strongly worded statement terming the japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the paris accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality the group of seven the united states japan west germany france britain italy and canada therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability the cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of billion to billion dlrs to halt the dollars fall while relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years monetary sources also said they understood that secretary baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the japanese announcement they also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over mediumterm policies has replaced the bickering over shortterm differences in past meetings west germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the paris agreement appears from the face of yesterdays statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable bonns finance minister gerhard stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between west germany and japans trade surpluses and americas trade deficit have already taken place no mention was made however of the us commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of paris european nations and japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record us trade shortfall that reached nearly billion dlrs last year a similar argument was made on capitol hill earlier this week by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker a further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent fed to drive up interest rates monetary sources said that privately west germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the us unit bonn and other european nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts tokyos export drive to the united states the japanese monolith will concentrate on european markets the ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one canadian finance minister michael wilson said good progress was made wilson said they will meet before the june economic summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations the united states and france backed by the international monetary fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required but the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has bonn and london worried monetary sources say because it implies washington is moving in the direction of target zones the sources said the reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the february meeting the concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the paris accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years

law professor at northwestern university in evanston ill was named thursday to be the rd chairman of the fivemember us securities and exchange commission if confirmed by the senate as expected he will succeed john shad who left the agency earlier this week after a record six years as chairman to become ambassador to the netherlands the sec has been in the limelight for the past year as its investigators have probed into the most colossal insider trading scandal ever uncovered on wall street the investigation which is still active mushroomed in recent months as a growing number of well known traders and prominent investment banking firms have been charged with wrongdoing the pace of the probe picked up markedly in november after ivan boesky one of wall streets most successful stock speculators agreed to cooperate with government investigators and to pay a record mln dlrs in penalties and illegal profits after being charged with insider trading but the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices spurred by computerdriven trading strategies that span markets in securities options and futures the price gyrations have combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented volatility to some us securities markets at the same time the sec is being pressed by some lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers steadily reshapes the us corporate landscape and the agency is being pushed by us and foreign exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork for an international securities marketplace in which trading occurs across borders throughout the world around the clock such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment opportunities but could strain the secs ability to enforce us securities laws and guard investors from fraud under the leadership of shad the sec eased financial disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies eliminated many minor investor protection rules attempted to spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agencys review of hostile corporate takeovers shad who had been vice chairman of the e f hutton investment banking firm brought a wall street perspective to the agency upon being named chairman in in line with the views of other top administration officials he favored marketplace determination of takeover battles over new federal regulations the sec under shad also stressed prosecution of insider trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that topped the agencys enforcement agenda during the administration of president jimmy carter a democrat securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with ruder say the new chairmandesignate is unlikely to significantly alter the commissions current priorities the sec currently has about employees most of them lawyers and an annual budget of about mln dlrs though that figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff the agency is one of the few in the government that actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past few years because of fees it charges public companies investment banks and other securities firms it regulates the sec is structured as an independent regulatory agency meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the president to fixed fiveyear terms and protected from firing for policy differences alone by law no more than three commissioners may be of the same political party and the agency prepares its own budget request each year instead of leaving this to the white house established by congress in the sec traces its origins to the great stock market crash of which was attributed in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted market manipulations by large investment firms the agency requires public companies and investment vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on their financial condition and to disclose changes in their condition any time they issue new securities it requires brokers dealers and investment banks to register with it and comply with investor protection rules and it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices its first chairman was joseph kennedy an industrial magnate who was also the father of john

propel the streamlined us petrochemical industry to record profits this year with growth expected through at least major company executives predicted this bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted gaf corp gaf privatelyheld cain chemical inc and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants oil companies such as ashland oil inc ash the kentuckybased oil refiner and marketer are also shopping for moneymaking petrochemical businesses to buy i see us poised at the threshold of a golden period said paul oreffice chairman of giant dow chemical co dow adding theres no major plant capacity being added around the world now the whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones analysts say the chemical industrys biggest customers automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics are expected to buy quantities this year us petrochemical plants are currently operating at about pct capacity reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by to pct this year said john dosher managing director of pace consultants inc of houston demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as pct he said oreffice speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in houston said dow would easily top the mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history in when oil prices were still above dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong us dollar dow had profits of mln dlrs i believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it oreffice said gaf chairman samuel heyman estimated that the us chemical industry would report a pct gain in profits during last year the domestic industry earned a total of billion dlrs a pct leap from the turn in the fortunes of the oncesickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning said paces john dosher dosher said last years fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the american dollar was weakening against foreign currencies that helped boost us chemical exports also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by middle eastern oil producers in the early s finally virtually all major us chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses the restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts gaf which made an unsuccessful attempt in to acquire union carbide corp uk recently offered three billion dlrs for borg warner corp bor a chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals another industry powerhouse wr grace gra has divested its retailing restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions but some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities such as ethylene in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are customdesigned for a small group of buyers companies like dupont dd and monsanto co mtc spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated dosher said but i think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market some top chemical executives share the concern the challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes gafs heyman cautioned the shift from commodity chemicals may be illadvised specialty businesses do not stay special long houstonbased cain chemical created this month by the sterling investment banking group believes it can generate mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend chairman gordon cain who previously led a leveraged buyout of duponts conoco incs chemical business has spent billion dlrs since january to buy seven petrochemical plants along the texas gulf coast the plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products this kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous highmargin business cain said adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually garo armen an analyst with dean witter reynolds said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum wood and steel products armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years provided the us economy continues its modest rate of growth

us treasury secretary james baker considered tokyos package announced yesterday to be a major stimulation of the japanese economy but yesterdays statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yens rise from around to the dollar the level at the february paris accord to about today and the initial reaction of currency markets in the far east demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals even though the countries appear to do so the yen sank below at one point despite intervention by the bank of japan kiichi miyazawa japans finance minister said the movement since paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the february talks i would say that what has happened to the yen in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in paris miyazawa said yesterday the supplementary budget worth about billion dlrs was announced by the ruling liberal democratic party on the eve of miyazawas departure for washington to attend yesterdays meetings of leading industrial nations in a strongly worded statement terming the japanese action extraordinary and urgent the meeting reaffirmed the paris accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals or economic reality the group of seven the united states japan west germany france britain italy and canada therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability the cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of billion to billion dlrs to halt the dollars fall while relatively unsuccessful the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years monetary sources also said they understood that secretary baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the japanese announcement they also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over mediumterm policies has replaced the bickering over shortterm differences in past meetings west germany whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the paris agreement appears from the face of yesterdays statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable bonns finance minister gerhard stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between west germany and japans trade surpluses and americas trade deficit have already taken place no mention was made however of the us commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of paris european nations and japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record us trade shortfall that reached nearly billion dlrs last year a similar argument was made on capitol hill earlier this week by federal reserve board chairman paul volcker a further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability he said volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent fed to drive up interest rates monetary sources said that privately west germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the us unit bonn and other european nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts tokyos export drive to the united states the japanese monolith will concentrate on european markets the ministers meanwhile also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one canadian finance minister michael wilson said good progress was made wilson said they will meet before the june economic summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations the united states and france backed by the international monetary fund want the seven to agree on ranges or norms for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth inflation monetary conditions trade balances and current account balances sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required but the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has bonn and london worried monetary sources say because it implies washington is moving in the direction of target zones the sources said the reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the february meeting the concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the paris accord and would mark a sharp departure from the
